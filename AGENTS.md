# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `content/` holds all site content as Markdown with TOML front matter (`+++ ... +++`), organized by section (e.g., `content/blog/`, `content/it-pro/`, `content/read/`). Section landing pages live in `_index.md` files.
- `templates/` contains Zola templates; `themes/serene/` provides the theme overrides and assets.
- `static/` holds files copied verbatim to the site (images, downloads, etc.).
- `public/` is the build output (generated by Zola; do not edit by hand).
- `config.toml` is the main site configuration.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `zola serve` starts a local dev server with live reload at `http://127.0.0.1:1111`.
- `zola build` generates the static site into `public/` for deployment.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Content files are Markdown with TOML front matter wrapped in `+++`.
- Follow existing naming patterns per section. For example, `content/it-pro/` includes descriptive titles with spaces, while some posts use date-based filenames.
- Keep edits consistent with surrounding formatting in `config.toml` and templates.

## Testing Guidelines

- This project does not include automated tests. Validate changes by running `zola build` and checking output in `public/`.
- For visual changes, review the site locally via `zola serve` and confirm template updates render as expected.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Recent history shows Conventional Commit-style prefixes such as `feat:` and `fix:`; prefer that style and use imperative, concise subjects.
- PRs should describe the change, mention affected sections (e.g., `content/blog/`), and include screenshots for visual or layout updates.

## Configuration & Content Tips

- `config.toml` controls site metadata, theme, taxonomies, and highlight themes. Keep `minify_html` set to `false` unless you confirm style issues are resolved.
- When adding new content sections, update `config.toml` `sections` so the navigation stays current.
