## Concept: Automated Custom Image Creation for AVD

### Objective

We implemented an automated process for creating and maintaining custom images for Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) using Azure Image Builder. The solution supports multiple environments and client types through a configuration-based approach, ensuring consistent and optimized image deployment across the organization.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Environment Support:** Single image build process supporting multiple environments and client types
- **Automation:** Fully automated image creation through pipeline integration
- **Configuration Management:** Uses configuration files for flexible environment-specific settings
- **Identity Management:** Specifically designed for Intune-managed AAD-only clients
- **Image Optimization:** Includes automated cleanup and optimization procedures
- **Post-Deployment:** Automated post-setup tasks after deployment

### Solution Overview

The solution encompasses the following key components and steps:

1. **Image Configuration Setup:**
   - Implementation of environment-specific configuration files
   - Setting of registry keys for client identification
   - Configuration of environment-specific settings

2. **Software Management:**
   - Automated software package download
   - Silent installation procedures
   - Environment-specific application deployment

3. **Image Optimization:**
   - Removal of unnecessary components (Bloatware)
   - System optimization for AVD workloads
   - Implementation of best practices for image management

4. **Automation Pipeline:**
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines
   - Automated triggering of new image builds
   - Version control and image management

5. **Post-Deployment Configuration:**
   - Automated post-setup script execution
   - AAD tenant join procedures
   - Client status tagging and validation

6. **Monitoring and Validation:**
   - Deployment status tracking
   - Client self-tagging verification
   - Success criteria validation
