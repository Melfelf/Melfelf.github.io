**Example Output:**  
Last weekend, I decided on a spontaneous trip to Cheyres, a picturesque village on the shore of Lake Neuchâtel. Packing was quick but thoughtful: sunscreen, swimwear, and of course, my Nintendo Switch were essentials. On the way, I stopped at Bern station for a delicious burger—just the right start for a short getaway.  
Once in Cheyres, relaxation was the order of the day: lounging by the lake, enjoying a BBQ, and winding down with an evening aperitif. Although the weather wasn’t ideal at first, I’m optimistic it will improve soon.
