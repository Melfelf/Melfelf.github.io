## A Structured Approach to AI-Enhanced Blogging

I've developed a systematic approach to using AI for enhancing my blog posts while maintaining authenticity. Here's how I structure my AI interactions to ensure consistent, high-quality content across different blog categories.

### Core Principles

My blogging process is built on four fundamental principles:

1. Preserve authentic thoughts and ideas
2. Present content clearly and accessibly
3. Use well-structured, fluent sentences
4. Maintain consistent formatting across categories
5. Be explicit about where AI contributed and where I edited manually

### Writing Style Guidelines

To ensure consistency, I've established these key guidelines for AI assistance:

- Maintain a natural, conversational tone
- Break down complex topics into digestible sections
- Include clear headings and structure
- Balance technical accuracy with readability
- Support both German and English content as appropriate
- Avoid using dashes within sentences, opt for commas or new sentences

### Category-Specific Templates

#### Technical Posts (IT-Pro)
For technical content, I structure my input like this:

- Objective
- Key Requirements/Features
- Solution Components

Example from a recent AVD post:
```plaintext
Topic: AVD Custom Image Creation
- Automated process needed
- Must support multiple environments
- Uses Azure Image Builder
- Needs configuration management
```

#### Personal Blog Posts
For personal content, I focus on:

- Key events/activities
- Main impressions
- Notable details

A recent example:
```plaintext
- Trip to Cheyres
- Packed essentials
- Lunch stop
- Lake activities
- Weather note
```

#### Book Reviews/Insights
For book reviews, I structure around:

- Book title
- Key concepts
- Personal insights

### Language Usage Guidelines

I've established clear language preferences for different content types:

- Technical posts: English
- Personal experiences: German preferred
- Book reviews: Language matching the source material

### Implementation Benefits

This structured approach has several advantages:

1. **Consistency:** All posts maintain a similar quality and style
2. **Efficiency:** Clear templates speed up the writing process
3. **Authenticity:** Original thoughts remain intact while improving clarity
4. **Accessibility:** Content is more digestible for readers

### Future Improvements

I'm continuously refining this system based on:

- Reader feedback
- Content effectiveness
- Writing efficiency
- AI capability developments

The goal is to maintain a balance between automated assistance and personal authenticity, ensuring each post reflects my voice while benefiting from AI's enhancing capabilities.

### Operational Checklist I Use Before Publishing

1. **Voice check**: Does the draft still sound like me?
2. **Fact check**: Every claim verified or clearly marked as opinion.
3. **Structure scan**: Headings, bullets, and short paragraphs for scannability.
4. **Metadata**: Dates, keywords, and reading time filled.
5. **Change log**: Note where AI suggestions were accepted or rejected.
