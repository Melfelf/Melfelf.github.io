## Train an AI Assistant

Welcome to the project space for creating a focused AI assistant tailored to real user workflows. This log tracks the full journey—from defining scope and curating examples to training, evaluating, and shipping iterative improvements.

### What to expect here

- **Design notes** on assistant behaviors, guardrails, and evaluation goals
- **Training logs** that document data choices, prompt structures, and Codex-based scaffolding
- **Playbooks** for testing, benchmarking, and monitoring quality over time
- **Deployment considerations** for integrating the assistant into real tools and processes

Follow along as we evolve from Codex prototypes to a reliable, production-ready assistant.
