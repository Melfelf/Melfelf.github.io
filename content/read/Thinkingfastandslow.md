"Thinking, Fast and Slow" is a groundbreaking book by Daniel Kahneman that explores the dual systems of thought that drive the way we make decisions. System 1 operates quickly and intuitively, while System 2 is slower, more deliberate, and logical. Kahneman delves into how these systems shape our judgments, influence our biases, and affect our everyday choices. The book combines insights from psychology and behavioral economics, offering readers a deeper understanding of how the mind works and how we can make better decisions by recognizing the strengths and limitations of each system.
