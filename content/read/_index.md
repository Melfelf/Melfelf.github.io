## Curated Reads

This section features books and audiobooks that have left an impression on me. Each recommendation comes with insights on key concepts and personal takeaways.

Someone invested significant time and effort into writing these works, which I believe enhances their quality. I only feature recommendations where I think this is particularly evident.
