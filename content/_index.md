Hi, I'm Stefan — also known as *Melf* — a systems engineer and lifelong learner with over two decades of experience in IT infrastructure. I specialize in automation, cloud technologies, and the intersection of human systems and digital transformation.

This space is dedicated to exploring how we can **Make Everything Less Frustrating With Automation & Robotic Execution** — from smart homes to intelligent frameworks, bridging virtual logic and real-world impact.

Welcome to my digital lab.
